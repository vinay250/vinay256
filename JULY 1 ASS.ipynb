        "ans:The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that organizes code and data into reusable and modular structures called objects. OOP aims to improve software development by promoting concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit called an object. It allows for better data protection and reduces dependencies between different parts of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing classes, allowing the derived classes to inherit properties and behaviors from their parent classes. This promotes code reuse, as common attributes and methods can be defined in a base class and inherited by multiple derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, providing a way to abstract and generalize code. This concept facilitates the creation of flexible and extensible software systems."
