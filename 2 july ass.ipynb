It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes where a derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) can inherit attributes and methods from a base class (also known as a superclass or parent class)."

        "ANS:Single Inheritance:\n",
        "Single inheritance refers to the situation where a derived class inherits properties and behaviors from a single base class.\n",
        "In single inheritance, a derived class can extend the functionality of a base class by adding new attributes and methods or by overriding the inherited methods.\n",
        "The class hierarchy forms a linear structure, with each derived class having a single direct base class.\n",

        "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "Multiple inheritance refers to the situation where a derived class inherits properties and behaviors from two or more base classes.\n",
        "In multiple inheritance, a derived class can inherit and combine features from multiple parent classes.\n",

        "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplicity: Single inheritance results in a simpler class hierarchy, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "Clear Relationships: Single inheritance establishes a clear and unambiguous relationship between the derived class and the base class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",

        "In single inheritance, the class hierarchy is linear, while multiple inheritance can result in a more complex and potentially diamond-shaped class hierarchy.\n",
        "Single inheritance is simpler and more straightforward to implement and understand, while multiple inheritance introduces more complexity and potential challenges, such as name clashes and method resolution order.\n",
        "Single inheritance emphasizes clarity, clear relationships, and simplicity, while multiple inheritance provides greater flexibility and code reuse at the cost of increased complexity."
